## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- BEM

### What I learned

I will more learn linear-gradient after this!
```CSS
    background: linear-gradient();
```

### Continued development

<!-- Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect. -->

### Useful resources

- [Fonts Google](https://fonts.google.com/) - This helped me for free fonts. It is good for beginner and faster for a simple project.
